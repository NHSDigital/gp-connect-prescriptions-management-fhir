    ## Overview

    Use this API to manage a patient's prescriptions as held by their GP practice.
    
    You can:

    * request a new instance of a repeat prescription

    * view all of a patients medications, whether acute or repeat, past or present

    * cancel a repeat prescription request
    
    * check the status of a current prescription request

    * request a new instance of a repeat prescription to a one off nomination pharmacy

    The end user must be a patient who is: 

    *  registered with the GP practice 

    *  registered with NHS login to P9 identity verification level

    For example:

    * a patient can view their own medication, request a new instance of a repeat prescription and cancel that request
    
    ## Who can use this API

    This API can be used by developers of clinical systems that support clinicans delivering direct care. It is a patient-facing API.
    
    This API:

    * is intended only for use by patient-facing applications

    * is intended only for non-clinical use

    * can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so

    Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with development. To do this, contact us. 

    You must do this before you can go live (see Onboarding below).

    ### Prerequisites 

    ####Information governance (IG)
    
    You must:

    * be compliant with the GP Connect Direct Care API Information Governance Model

    ####Clinical safety 

    You must:

    * have a clinical safety officer (CSO) who is responsible for DCB0129 and, if necessary, DCB0160. For more on clinical risk management, visit Clinical risk management standards

    ## API status and roadmap
    
    This API is in [development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses)

    To see our roadmap or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog.](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/341619/gp-connect-prescriptions-management-fhir)

    If you have any other queries, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support)

    ## Service level

    This API is a silver service, meaning it is operational 24 x 7 x 365 but only supported during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.
    
    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology

    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.

    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against [FHIR UK Core, specifically [UKcore.stu1 0.5.1](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1/0.5.1).

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
    
    * resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Patient` not `/patients`
    
    * array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    
    * data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    There are [libraries and software development kits available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access

    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    For more details, see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation

    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it. 

    The end user must be:

    * a patient

    * authenticated with NHS login to P9 identity verification level

    The API uses Open ID Connect to authenticate the end user and OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling system. It supports the following security pattern using NHS login: 
    
    * [User-restricted RESTful APIs - NHS login separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-login-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    ## Environments and testing
    
    |Environment|Base URL|
    |-----------|--------|
    |Sandbox|`https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/gp-connect/prescriptions/FHIR/R4`|
    |Integration Testing|`Not yet available`|
    |Production|`Not yet available`|

    ### Sandbox testing 

    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):

    * is for early developer testing

    * only covers a limited set of scenarios

    * is stateless, so it does not store data

    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ### Integration testing (not yet available)
    
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    
    * is for formal integration testing
    
    * is stateful, so it does persist data
    
    * includes authorisation
    
    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding

    We are hoping to make the assurance process as lightweight and as self-service as possible.

    ## Resources

    Use the [GP Connect Prescriptions Management Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/GP-Connect-Prescription-Management-FHIR-PFS) to assist with your integration.

    This is the FHIR specification for GP Connect Prescriptions.

    ## Errors

    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action

    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application

    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

        ## Overview 

        Use this end point to create a request for a repeat prescription or repeat dispensing prescription. The same end point can be used to request a prescription to a one off pharmacy nomination - the ODS code is set in MedicationRequest.dispenseRequest.performer. 

        For this, send a task with a focus of the MedicationRequest. The MedicationRequest should be contained within the Task resource.

      parameters:
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/BearerAuthorization"
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/CorrelationID"
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/RequestID"
